 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *  This implementation was created by studying many existing examples
 *  found in Open Source, in the public domain, and in various documentation.
 *  The SMB protocol makes minimal use of the DES function, so this is a
 *  minimal implementation.  That which is not required has been removed.
 *
 *  The SMB protocol uses the DES algorithm as a hash function, not an
 *  encryption function.  The auth_DEShash() implemented here is a one-way
 *  function.  The reverse is not implemented in this module.  Also, there
 *  is no attempt at making this either fast or efficient.  There is no
 *  need, as the auth_DEShash() function is used for generating the LM
 *  Response from a 7-byte key and an 8-byte challenge.  It is not intended
 *  for use in encrypting large blocks of data or data streams.
 *
 *  As stated above, this implementation is based on studying existing work
 *  in the public domain or under Open Source (specifically LGPL) license.
 *  The code, however, is written from scratch.  Obviously, I make no claim
 *  with regard to those earlier works (except to claim that I am grateful
 *  to the previous implementors whose work I studied).  See the list of
 *  references below for resources I used.
 *
 *  References:
 *    I read through the libmcrypt code to see how they put the pieces
 *    together.  See: http://mcrypt.hellug.gr/

   *                bitmap will be written.
   *          src - Source byte array.
   *
   *  Output: none.
   *
   *  Notes:  It's really not possible (for me, anyway) to understand how
   *          this works without reading one or more detailed explanations.
   *          Quick overview, though:
   *
   *          After the DataExpansion step (in which a 32-bit bit array is
   *          expanded to a 48-bit bit array) the expanded data block is
   *          XOR'd with 48-bits worth of key.  That 48 bits then needs to
   *          be condensed back into 32 bits.
   *
   *          The S-Box substitution handles the data reduction by breaking
   *          the 48-bit value into eight 6-bit values.  For each of these
   *          6-bit values there is a table (an S-Box table).  The table
   *          contains 64 possible values.  Conveniently, a 6-bit integer
   *          can represent a value between 0 and 63.
   *
   *          So, if you think of the 48-bit bit array as an array of 6-bit
   *          integers, you use S-Box table 0 with the 0th 6-bit value.
   *          Table 1 is used with the 6-bit value #1, and so on until #7.
   *          Within each table, the correct substitution is found based
   *          simply on the value of the 6-bit integer.
   *
   *          Well, the original algorithm (and most documentation) don't
   *          make it so simple.  There's a complex formula for mapping
   *          the 6-bit values to the correct substitution.  Fortunately,
   *          those lookups can be precomputed (and have been for this
   *          implementation).  See pp 274-274 in Schneier.
   *
   *          Oh, and the substitute values are all 4-bit values, so each
   *          6-bits gets reduced to 4-bits resulting in a 32-bit bit array.

   *
   *        - This function is called "DEShash" rather than just "DES"

   *          is a full DES encryption implementation.
   *
   *        - This DES implementation does not need to be fast, nor is a
   *          DES decryption function needed.  The goal is to keep the
   *          code small, simple, and well documented.
   *
   *        - The input values are copied and refiddled within the module
   *          and the result is not written to <dst> until the very last
